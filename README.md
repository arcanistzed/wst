A toolkit for internal use in World Smiths products. Not intended for general use, but please feel free to poke around.

This module currently only extends the TinyMCE editor to add Find-and-Replace, Templates for conversion notes, and various blocks for making parts of the content stand out. Check out the [TinyMCE Extended](https://gitlab.com/geekswordsman/textended) module where I contributed these features for a broader use case.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://github.com/arcanistzed/wst/releases/latest/download/module.json` to install the module.

## Usage

A copy of the World Smiths CSS files must be present in your project.
